### Knovolo

**Centralized Knowledge Management and Onboarding Platform for Enterprises**

Knovolo is a SaaS solution designed for B2B teams to centralize company knowledge, streamline onboarding, and enhance operational efficiency. It combines machine-learning-driven knowledge retrieval, structured workflow recording, and forum-based collaboration into one integrated platform that grows with your organization.

### Core Capabilities

**Machine Learning-Assisted Knowledge Finder**
Knovolo helps users quickly find answers by searching relevant documents, previously answered forum posts, and recorded SOP-Paths. If no suitable results are found, the question is automatically posted to an organization-specific forum, where other users can provide answers. The best answers are saved and indexed for future searches, ensuring the knowledge base continuously improves.

**Workflow Recording & SOP Tracking**

* Browser extension records workflows by capturing button clicks, mouse and keyboard input, website and application context
* SOPs are reusable, replayable, and stored centrally
* Automatic suggestions of relevant SOPs when users encounter roadblocks
* SOPs accessible from any web application or through the extension
* Supports overlay instructions for real-time guidance

### How Knowledge Grows with Knovolo

When a user cannot find an answer:

1. The Knowledge Finder searches documents, SOPs and past forum answers.
2. If no relevant results appear, the question is posted automatically to the internal forum.
3. When answered, the best response is saved and made available in future searches.

This approach creates a continuously evolving, self-learning knowledge system.
