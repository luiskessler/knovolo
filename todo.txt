DEDICATED VECTOR DB SERVICE?

- HANDLE ECNRYPTION FOR BILLING ADDRESS IN DATABASE

-- remove cron email services from Frontend
-- move heavy email services to backend
-- remove all cron related code from Frontend
-- move upload related code to backend

- Fix Organization Status Toast (sending twice - onMount) - add content

- Configure querying redis before making DB calls (general REDIS layer? key: "table+orgID" o.Ã¤)

- Signup - password pre verification

AWS-Migration: 
- Update URL-Construction in storage.ts
- Storage Content Upload: update Database with URL; Vector DB insert; Success Message Frontend - Add Logo / User Avatar Uploads



- SECURE API ROUTES - getToken() + getSession() + getUser() + getOrganization() / CRON_JOB_SECRET / OTHER SECRETS + (LOGGING for when missing tokens are used)

// DONE - Update E-Mail Send Functions to check for previous E-Mails (should only be in TRPC-Routers) + Write into db -- write into DB -- sendEmail covers writing - check only needed with CRON Jobs

// DONE - Organization Verification JWT into JWT Tokens Table

// NOT NEEDED - Include Subtext on <SearchableTable /> - optional; for dashboard/questions -> display answer count under <tr>

- Add New Question Modal - !! do V-DB Query before Adding !!

- "Use Path" => start Browser Extension + route the User to the first Step of the Path - path slug / ID

- Notification System for Dashboard; Notification DB Table + handleNotification(); Type + amt (anti-spam (group if alr. send / make text generic "You have new answers for your Question."))

- /dashboard/questions?question=ID; always start Chat at Bottom of Scrollcontainer via useRef

// DONE - on Organization Submit => addAllowedDomain() from Admin-Email

- Gamification Functionality - Points System (Leaderboards, Badges, Levels) => for each added Path, good answer (upvoated by OP), 
- Questions - For Question OP => Allow selecting one (or multiple) Answers as the "Correct" Answer => Add to Vector DB for later Answer Generation

TODO TOMORROW - Bulk Team Migration Integrations (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Asana, Jira, Monday.com, Trello, CSV)

- Dashboard Chat - Allow adding Path / Media to Message
- Dashboard Chat - Answers - Reply to Answer - Scroll to Answer
- Dashboard Chat - Websocket connection

Embedding Layer + Vector DB Functions

- Embedding Layer (Vector DB) -> Should be able to handle Keywords, Categories, Tags, etc. + Title
- handleParseFile() + getFileData(//should be able to get general topic of a file + generate keywords (AI-Powered?)) -> File Upload -> Link to SQL DB via fileID => only store fileID in V-DB
- handleParsePath() - Path Upload -> Link to SQL DB via pathID => only store pathID in V-DB

Organization

- FOR Cron Jobs + Trial Period: Change Status ENUM: "trial", "trial ended", "active", "pending", "inactive", "onboarding"

- If trying to verify Organization via E-Mail when not signed in first verify USER has a Session (same page or keep token)
- Bulk Teams Migration (Teams, CSV-Upload)
- Create New Organization; if Org already exists, Front-End Prompt: "Ask your admin to invite you."

- Prompt Payment Information - After status: "trial-ended"
- Payment Information - After provided setStatus("active) 

// DONE - Invite Employee - check validity E-Mail Domain -- DONE
// DONE - Validate Domain on new Organization -- Not needed as we check for email TLD validity + not taking Website URL anyway
